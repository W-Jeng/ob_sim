# Order book simulation
Highly efficient orderbook implementation done in OOP fashion and uses min-max heap tree structure.

Key features:
1) Get top-level order for bid ask price in O(1) time complexity.
2) Cancel order in O(1) time complexity using hash map!
3) Adding new price-point in the limit order book takes O(log N).
4) FIFO queue for new orders at particular limit order.
5) Tabulating the limit order book that shows aggregating order at the limit price.
